# Devastate

Ultra dark theme and color scheme for Sublime Text.

Based on Spacegray/Spacefunk themes and Laravel color scheme.


### Theme

Theme shamelessly ripped from Spacefunk theme, reduced size of tabs and other elements to improve screen estate.


### Color scheme

Laravel color scheme by Dayle Rees with slightly modified colors, blue numbers and green language constants.

Supports SublimeLinter (Bottom right tab group on the screenshot).


### Tips

Font on the screenshots is `Droid Sans Mono`. You may change it in the theme if you clone the package and edit `Devastate.sublime-theme`.


### TODO

+ Implement missing scope elements to the color scheme.
+ Implement scope elements for most popular packages.
