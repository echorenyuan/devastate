# Devastate

Ultra dark theme and color scheme for Sublime Text.

Based on [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray)/[Spacefunk](https://github.com/Twiebie/ST-Spacefunk) themes and [Laravel color scheme](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes) by [Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees).

### Theme

Theme shamelessly ripped from [Spacefunk](https://github.com/Twiebie/ST-Spacefunk) theme, reduced size of tabs and other elements to improve screen estate.


### Color scheme

[Laravel color scheme](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes) by [Dayle Rees](https://github.com/daylerees) with slightly modified colors, blue numbers and green language constants.

Supports [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3) (Bottom right tab group on the screenshot).


### Tips

Font on the screenshots is `Droid Sans Mono`. You may change it in the theme if you clone the package and edit `Devastate.sublime-theme`.


### TODO

+ Implement missing scope elements to the color scheme.
+ Implement scope elements for most popular packages.
